## Exercise 1 : Linear Regression

A linear regression implemented from scratch

## Exercise 2 : Binary Logistic Regression

A binary logistic regression implemented from scratch using stochastic gradient descent algorithm
to find the optimal theta parameters

## Exercise 3: Multinomial Logistic Regression

A multinomial regularized logistic Regression implemented from scratch. The data that i used was the MNIST
dataset to predict handwritten digits. To train the model the One vs All gradient descent
algorithm used.

## Exercise 4: Support Vector Machines
For this exercise i had to develop gaussian kernels that measures the similarity between
2 vectors (observation x and landmark l) and to develop a spam ham classifier

## Exercise 5: kmeans and Pca

For this exercise i had to develop the kmeans and pca algorithm from scratch. These 
algorithms are classified as un supervised machine learning algorithms.

Kmeans: Creates clusters from points that are close to specific points

PCA: Is an algorithm that used for dimensionality reduction
